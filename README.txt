This project is done using Tinkercad simulator. 
The circuit diagram is shared which can be used to create the actual hardware as well.

This is SMART DUSTBIN that opens the cap of itself when a user comes near the dustbin.
Once the garbage is thrown inside the dustbin, and person is moved away, the cap gets closed automatically.
If the dustbin is 90% full, it will not open the cap in any case. 
All the status is printed on Display provided.
